Unfortunately this tool dosen't have auto captcha i tried including it but turns out Microsoft added new protection against Token captcha's.

I have talked to [2captcha.com](https://2captcha.com/enterpage) administrator about this, this is what he said, 

Live.com/hotmail/outlook has changed something so for now they are not accepting our tokens though the tokens are fine.
We continue the research on this matter. Currently the main idea is that live.com added some additional tracking (as you can see they have telemetry tracking requests made to their backend) and most probably if the events related to captcha solving are not happening, any captcha token is declined. When we find a solution that can be made on our side, we will share it with all users who are interested in this.

So for know its going to be manual captcha untill Captcha services find a bypass for new security, i'll update the code to include auto captcha one's they do.
